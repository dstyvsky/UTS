Since 2006, UTS has been providing import and export logistics service through the Ports of Baltimore and has invested in equipment able to lift and move large heavy material weighing up to 65,000 lbs.  In August 2011, UTS opened a 2nd warehouse location servicing the Ports of Charleston and Savannah in Orangeburg, SC.  UTS has also expanded its capabilities into the rail siding transload service, slab cutting service, expanded packaging services, light manufacturing services (welding & metal cutting), and additional heavy weight handling and freight service capabilities through Fraley and Schilling. </p>
